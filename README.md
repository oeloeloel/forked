# Forked
Forked is a prototype system for scripting interactive narratives in DragonRuby.

Forked uses a simplified markup similar to markdown. It is intended to be simple to use, easy to learn for people without programming experience and to make it easier to focus on writing.

Additional functionality can be added by writing commands in Ruby.

What it lets you do:
* Write stories in a readable format with minimal distraction
* Player navigates to different parts of your story with button clicks
* Issue commands from within your story
* Premade commands available for non-programmers
* Custom commands are simple to create using Ruby
* Conditions allow you to control what the player sees
* Show or hide text based on conditions
* Show or hide buttons based on conditions
* Buttons can link to other parts of the story or run code

## Getting started
Download or clone the project and run it in DragonRuby.

The default project is the user manual. [Click here to see how it's built!](https://github.com/oeloeloel/forked/blob/main/app/story.md?plain=1)

## Quick Reference

#### Story title:
```
# Title
```

#### Chunk heading and ID:
```
## Heading Name {#chunk_id}`
```

#### Trigger and target:
Target a chunk by Chunk ID
```
[Trigger text](#target_id)
```

Target the following chunk in the story file:
```
[Trigger text](#)
```

Display an inactive trigger:
```
[Trigger text]()
```

#### Blockquote:
```
> This text is displayed as a blockquote.
```

#### Code Block:
```
~~~
# This text is displayed as code, in a monospace font with lines wrapped for length but otherwise without any changes.
~~~
```

#### Horizontal Rule:
```
---
```

#### Chunk action:
```
::
action
::
```

#### Trigger action:
```
[Trigger text](:
action
:)
```

#### Conditional text (string interpolation):
```
<:
condition
:>
```

#### Conditional text (show/hide text):
```
<:
condition
::
This text is displayed if the condition is true.
:>
```

#### Comment:
```
// this line is a comment
```

## Formatting
#### Blockquotes:
```
> This text is inside a blockquote
> This text is inside the same blockquote
```

#### Code Blocks (not executable):
````
~~~
This text looks like code
~~~
````

#### Preformat
```
@@ any formatting in this line is ignored
```

### Hard Wrap
Add a backslash `\` at the end of a line to display the following line in the file to display as a new line in Forked (instead of continuing the same line).
```
This is the first line\
This is the second line
```
